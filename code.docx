# Core Functionality Implementation

## Sample Data Creation
I implemented a data generation module that produces synthetic sales records for testing purposes. The implementation uses pandas' date_range functionality to create sequential dates, combined with cyclical product names and randomized quantity and sales values. This approach allowed me to test the application without requiring users to provide their own datasets during development and demonstrations.

## Email Automation System
For the email functionality, I built a robust email service that handles attachments. The implementation utilizes Python's standard libraries including smtplib and the EmailMessage class. This system securely connects to Gmail's SMTP server over SSL, authenticates with stored credentials, and transmits both message content and file attachments.

The attachment handling includes proper MIME type specification and filename preservation. I implemented comprehensive error handling with try-except blocks to capture and report any issues during the connection, authentication, or transmission phases.

For security considerations, I implemented environmental variable storage for sensitive credentials rather than embedding them in the codebase. The function also provides detailed success or failure feedback to the calling application.

These core components form the foundation of the application, with the Streamlit interface serving primarily as a presentation layer that interacts with these backend services.
